Upload a picture and see what the simpsonized version of that image looks like.

This is a small project as result of Tanishq Abraham's [UPIT](https://github.com/tmabraham/UPIT) the book [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD](https://www.amazon.de/Deep-Learning-Coders-Fastai-Pytorch/dp/1492045527).

The following button brings you to the app. But you'll have to wait until a server is up and running. **This can take up to five minutes!**
